Machine Learning from its definition is defined as "Field of Study that gives Computers the <u>The ability to learn without being Programmed</u>."
From this definition i was astonished computers learn.
So far we have been hearning that computers don't have brain but now after seeing the definition it says computers learn so they have brain too, so i thought machine learning is God of Computer Science literally not God but its like a doctor who has implanted brain to a computer. So computers don't need rest and now they have brain.<i>"So &nbsp;it&nbsp; could &nbsp;solve most of our problems"</i> was my first thought. This thought came to me in 2018 by the time AI/ML was new but many applications were developed such as

<ol>
  <li> Google News which uses Machine Learning Algorithms </li>
  <li>Google Now</li>
  <li>Face Recognition and Tagging Images on Facebook </li>
</ol>
So I thought machine learning would be very easy and we can build almost anything.
So my love started with it and i am loving it till now though its not a one sided love even Machine Learning Loves me thats why it urges me to spend my time in it. In every love there may be disagreements,fights and Quarells but in this love there only bugs and error which i have to clear it to stay in the relationship.
